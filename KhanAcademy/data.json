We’ll finally put it all together by relating pressure, flow, and resistance in one awesome equation!","title":"Blood Pressure","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/science/healthcare-and-medicine/the-heart/blood_pressure","children":[{"id":"1035877811","title":"What is blood pressure?","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/J97G6BeYW0I/0.jpg"},{"id":"1036248186","title":"Learn how a stethoscope can help determine blood pressure","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8xO92u0VFs/0.jpg"},{"id":"1036250178","title":"Resistance in a tube","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/8X7yEzgurP8/0.jpg"},{"id":"1036040971","title":"Adding up resistance in series and in parallel","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/E-q9JpkGc-8/0.jpg"},{"id":"1036034566","title":"Adding up resistance problem","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5lXw5_4R2B4/0.jpg"},{"id":"1192925086","title":"Flow and Perfusion","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ePwN6rHhNyU/0.jpg"},{"id":"1036166642","title":"Putting it all together: Pressure, flow, and resistance","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/F2uzWHppVrk/0.jpg"},{"id":"1036127574","title":"Blood pressure changes over time","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/fy_muPF0390/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"x9c98f570","domainId":"xb92336a2","description":"The human body enjoys stability. For example, if your blood pressure changes, the body puts a couple of brilliant systems into motion in order to respond and bring your blood pressure back to normal.  There are some quick responses using nerves and some slower responses using hormones.  The system using hormones is sometimes called the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS), which is the main system in the body for controlling blood pressure. When your blood pressure drops too low or gets too high, your kidneys, liver, and pituitary gland (part of your brain) talk to each other to solve the problem. They do this without you even noticing! Learn how the body knows when the blood pressure has changed, and how hormones like angiotensin 2, aldosterone, and ADH help return blood pressure to back to normal.","title":"Blood Pressure Control","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/science/healthcare-and-medicine/the-heart/blood_pressure_control","children":[{"id":"1036230273","title":"Regulation of blood pressure with baroreceptors","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ajLgwCygHsc/0.jpg"},{"id":"1036126972","title":"Parts of a nephron","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_vBJkK4eocA/0.jpg"},{"id":"1047183569","title":"General overview of the RAAS system - Cells and hormones","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/BVUeCLt68Ik/0.jpg"},{"id":"1047335429","title":"Renin production in the kidneys","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/AtlhAhONHyM/0.jpg"},{"id":"1047465049","title":"Activating Angiotensin 2","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/cUVS0AlRyw8/0.jpg"},{"id":"1047330622","title":"Angiotensin 2 raises blood pressure","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oges5YqDLHY/0.jpg"},{"id":"1047114997","title":"Aldosterone raises blood pressure and lowers potassium","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/64_ZfIemRGM/0.jpg"},{"id":"1047406243","title":"Aldosterone removes acid from the blood","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/7HTy-6NLWGM/0.jpg"},{"id":"1047456036","title":"ADH secretion","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/8dQdfbE8kFU/0.jpg"},{"id":"1047327652","title":"ADH effects on blood pressure","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ot1We4_EfRE/0.jpg"},{"id":"1058371798","title":"Aldosterone and ADH","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z0XPMFL45oo/0.jpg"}]}]},{"type":2,"id":"xd590f813","description":"Get a better understanding of how your lungs help you to sing and survive!","title":"The Lungs","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/science/healthcare-and-medicine/the-lungs","children":[{"type":3,"id":"xd544173e","domainId":"xb92336a2","description":"","title":"Lung Introduction","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/science/healthcare-and-medicine/the-lungs/lung_introduction","children":[{"id":"1150539313","title":"Meet the lungs","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qGiPZf7njqY/0.jpg"},{"id":"1150475491","title":"People and plants","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/lzWUG4H5QBo/0.jpg"},{"id":"1159072701","title":"The Bronchial Tree","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z-yv3Yq4Aw4/0.jpg"},{"id":"1179650621","title":"Inhaling and Exhaling","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/mykrnTh1tz8/0.jpg"},{"id":"1179655597","title":"How does Lung Volume Change?","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/dTsUyXXudvA/0.jpg"},{"id":"23986","title":"The Lungs and Pulmonary System","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SPGRkexI_cs/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"x3f397449","domainId":"xb92336a2","description":"","title":"Gas Exchange","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/science/healthcare-and-medicine/the-lungs/gas_exchange","children":[{"id":"x8fbef923","title":"Alveolar Gas Equation - Part 1","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/zZX9jJqSlQs/0.jpg"},{"id":"x074ad05b","title":"Alveolar Gas Equation - Part 2","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xH5Y3Kmx82w/0.jpg"},{"id":"xeab45ce1","title":"O2 and CO2 solubility","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/OCD4Dr3kmmA/0.jpg"},{"id":"x33409079","title":"Henry's law","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wiuat7KdMmA/0.jpg"},{"id":"x934cb9f8","title":"Graham's Law of Diffusion","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/g6QuuoTs2Oo/0.jpg"},{"id":"x0f010548","title":"Fick's Law of Diffusion","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cg4KlmI_acs/0.jpg"},{"id":"x536c7d31","title":"Oxygen Movement from Alveoli to Capillaries","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/nRpwdwm06Ic/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"x23de9609","domainId":"xb92336a2","description":"","title":"Breathing Control","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/science/healthcare-and-medicine/the-lungs/breathing_control","children":[{"id":"x8b9eb0eb","title":"Peripheral Chemoreceptors","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/cJXY3Cywrnc/0.jpg"},{"id":"x03a3321c","title":"Central Chemoreceptors","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/lVacrVMmJX8/0.jpg"},{"id":"x775cfe3b","title":"The Respiratory Center","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BFDgTci0ck/0.jpg"},{"id":"xb6078c7d","title":"Sneeze, Cough, and Hiccup","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/V2vR5_B6C5I/0.jpg"}]}]},{"type":2,"id":"x0b35bcd7","description":"Most people have had the flu virus at least once in their lives, and it’s usually not a pleasant experience…  Fight back with some good information!

Charlemagne and the Ottonians had partially and briefly unified the West, and of course the Church was a stabilizing institution, but it was only in the 11th Century that everything changed. Now there was finally enough peace and prosperity to allow for travel and for the widespread construction of large buildings. These were, with rare exceptions, the first large structures to be built in the West since the fall of the Romans so many centuries before. We call the period Romanesque (Roman-like) because the masons of this period looked back to the architecture of ancient Rome. The relative calm of the Romanesque period also meant it was possible to travel, and the faithful set out on pilgrimages in great numbers to visit holy relics in churches across Europe.

Duccio and his students, the Lorenzetti Brothers and Simone Martini produced large-scale painting with an intricacy and subtle coloration that is unique in the Renaissance.","title":"Art History: Siena","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1300-1400-proto-renaissance/siena","children":[{"id":"952862569","title":"Duccio's Maesta (front)","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2fijnNzktDI/0.jpg"},{"id":"952728915","title":"Duccio's Maesta (back)","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/w6Tgu14VSLY/0.jpg"},{"id":"575708250","title":"Duccio, The Rucellai Madonna, 1285-86","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/1JL5ZR-ocOs/0.jpg"},{"id":"671563208","title":"Duccio's Madonna and Child","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0d9TB0DAOyY/0.jpg"},{"id":"671702322","title":"Duccio's The Virgin and Child with Saints Dominic and Aurea","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pu1WCHsYfKQ/0.jpg"},{"id":"1261328967","title":"Ambrogio Lorenzetti's Palazzo Pubblico frescos: Allegory and Effect of Good and Bad Government","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/jk3wNadYA7k/0.jpg"},{"id":"719804656","title":"Lorenzetti's Presentation of Jesus in the Temple","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_lzdhIHLwcQ/0.jpg"},{"id":"671702323","title":"Simone Martini's Annunciation","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PsgPJoGWig/0.jpg"},{"id":"671632335","title":"Nicola, Pulpit, Pisa Baptistery; and Giovanni Pisano, Slaughter of the Innocents, Pulpit, Sant'Andrea church, Pistoia","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/DXEG8l1FRRk/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"x12007035","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"When Vasari wrote his enormously influential book, Lives of the Artists, in the 16th century, he credited Giotto, the 14th century Florentine artist with beginning \"the great art of painting as we know it today, introducing the technique of drawing accurately from life, which had been neglected for more than two hundred years.\" In other words, for Vasari, Giotto was the first artist to leave behind the medieval practice of painting what one knows and believes, for the practice of painting what one sees.

Its fabulous wealth financed the construction of sumptuous churches and palaces—and art to fill them. The city’s salty, humid air meant that frescos faded quickly and so in the late 15th century, artists adopted oil, a medium they had seen used on panels from the north.

In this tutorial, we take a look at Pacher’s amazing St. Wolfgang Altarpiece which is still in the church it was made for—a church on a lake surrounded by mountains in Austria, still visited by religious pilgrims. Most altarpieces in the Renaissance were made of many interconnected panels that were later sold and ended up in different collections, and this means that to see one altarpiece you usually have to travel to many museums.

Before this, in Western Europe, there was only one type of Christianity—under the authority of the Pope in Rome. But in 1517 a German theologian and monk, Martin Luther, sparked the Protestant Reformation. His ideas spread quickly, thanks in part to the printing press. Luther challenged the power of the Pope and the Church, and asserted the authority of individual conscience. At the same time, it was increasingly possible for people to read the bible in the languages that they spoke. It is also during this period that the Scientific Revolution began and observation replaced religious doctrine as the source of our understanding of the universe and our place in it. At mid-century, Copernicus suggested that the sun was at the center of solar system (not the earth), radically repositioning human beings and therefore calling into question our centrality in the universe that God had created.","title":"1500-1600 End of the Renaissance and the Reformation","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1500-1600-end-of-the-renaissance-and-the-reformation","children":[{"type":3,"id":"x9a536edf","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"We don’t call this the “High” Renaissance for nothing!

The Venetians favored the sumptuous, the exotic and the poetic and created art for a society that had grown wealthy trading with distant lands.","title":"Art History: Venice","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1500-1600-end-of-the-renaissance-and-the-reformation/venice-1","children":[{"id":"x518e582a","title":"Giorgione, The Tempest, c. 1506-8","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/LFA_qmGuY2A/0.jpg"},{"id":"1327610976","title":"Giorgione, Three Philosophers, c. 1506","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/RD_Mh_SDz3s/0.jpg"},{"id":"1064641631","title":"Giorgione's The Adoration of the Shepherds","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/M0Nf2Osgwkc/0.jpg"},{"id":"719842161","title":"Titian, Noli me Tangere","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rw8XE6hvHBo/0.jpg"},{"id":"671686561","title":"Titian, Portrait of a Man ","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/AAeBt4zGDUA/0.jpg"},{"id":"xa4813afb","title":"Titian, Assumption of the Virgin","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2MzPOrcsWB0/0.jpg"},{"id":"x00089ddd","title":"Titian, Madonna of the Pesaro Family","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ngmZo-dvy4/0.jpg"},{"id":"671536488","title":"Bellini and Titian, The Feast of the Gods","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mx59hYSFCeA/0.jpg"},{"id":"671610555","title":"Titian, Bacchus and Ariadne","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/bYyxwxEqTQo/0.jpg"},{"id":"719832193","title":"Titian, Venus of Urbino","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qD6ct0VS15c/0.jpg"},{"id":"1245418600","title":"Titian, Christ Crowned with Thorns","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVUH4-Wsdwg/0.jpg"},{"id":"956722642","title":"Correggio, Jupiter and Io","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/hrBMFNvvOBI/0.jpg"},{"id":"719832192","title":"Veronese, The Family of Darius Before Alexander","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YnYknwUqaCM/0.jpg"},{"id":"719682567","title":"Veronese, The Dream of Saint Helena","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/PI9DjVjeV2A/0.jpg"},{"id":"xdb9318cf","title":"Paolo Veronese.

American artists looked to England for support and inspiration, often to the older Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was the painter to the King, and first President of the Royal Academy in London.","title":"Art History: English Portraiture","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1700-1800-age-of-enlightenment/english-portraiture","children":[{"id":"671563222","title":"Reynolds, Lady Cockburn and Her Three Eldest Sons","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NX3M0NTYTYg/0.jpg"},{"id":"719842162","title":"Copley, Boy with a Squirrel","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/60u_ctp6UIw/0.jpg"},{"id":"719842163","title":"Peale, Staircase Group (Portrait of Raphaelle Peale and Titian Ramsay Peale)","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vm1_vSny4BY/0.jpg"}]}]},{"type":2,"id":"xd2351824","description":"With the failure of the French Revolution (Napoleon crowned himself Emperor, and after his defeat, a King was restored to power in France), there was a turn away from public, political life, toward personal, subjective experience.

More and more people lived in cities and worked in factories or shops for wages. Scientific and technological advances increased dramatically during this period and although there was dislocation and privation, standards of living increased sharply. In essence, modern mass culture was born. Artists responded sometimes by embracing these radical changes, and at other times by resisting them. Key here is understanding the authority of the various art academies in Europe, which controlled matters related to taste and art, and which were, to some extent, always connected to the government. A small number of artists rebelled against the strictures of the academy, and against the demand for art to tell clear stories for a middle class audience, and formed what we know as the “avant-garde.”","title":"1848-1907 Industrial Revolution II","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1848-1907-industrial-revolution-ii","children":[{"type":3,"id":"xe6a81777","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"In 1848, a small group of young artists banded together and formed “The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood,” a name which sounds intentionally backward-looking and medieval.

Their idea was that the art before Raphael was more sincere, more true to nature and how we see, and therefore less formulaic. These artists also embraced a wide range of subjects, including modern life, biblical and literary subjects, and even history.

Courbet painted the reality of life in the countryside—not the idealized peasants that were the usual fare at the exhibits in Paris. The revolution of 1848, in which both the working class and the middle class played a significant role, set the stage for Realism.

This tutorial explores the sketchy multiperspectival views of Cézanne, Seurat’s systematized critiques of upper middle-class Paris, Gauguin’s fascination with the primitive and exotic, and van Gogh’s unerring ability to convey deeply human experiences.","title":"Art History: Post-Impressionism","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1848-1907-industrial-revolution-ii/post-impressionism","children":[{"id":"719842168","title":"Seurat, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/wNB9Vm6MoDQ/0.jpg"},{"id":"671634393","title":"Seurat, Bathers at Asnières","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9bs1iQ14LJY/0.jpg"},{"id":"671593306","title":"Seurat, Young Woman Powdering Herself","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWPRKyqyJUo/0.jpg"},{"id":"669368682","title":"Cézanne, Still Life with Apples","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/hH1a1v1JNAk/0.jpg"},{"id":"671738038","title":"Cézanne, Still-Life with Plaster Cupid","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBPgPEo0Xx4/0.jpg"},{"id":"719786823","title":"Cézanne, The Red Rock","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Vv9BhnE0SQ/0.jpg"},{"id":"719474984","title":"Cézanne, Bathers","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/iQY3SdZeZ6g/0.jpg"},{"id":"719786827","title":"Cezanne, The Large Bathers","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFtf-xA7_oM/0.jpg"},{"id":"671385811","title":"Gauguin, The Red Cow","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofJS_K0Fj2Q/0.jpg"},{"id":"671656227","title":"Gauguin, Nevermore","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/pQu1RMIkg3c/0.jpg"},{"id":"671385808","title":"Van Gogh, Portrait of the Joseph Roulin","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/uIXS5-cFhYI/0.jpg"},{"id":"671656229","title":"Van Gogh, Self-Portrait Dedicated to Paul Gauguin","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gqSpWPONekE/0.jpg"},{"id":"719804658","title":"Van Gogh, The Bedroom","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/E1tA9-ypx0g/0.jpg"},{"id":"719836280","title":"Toulouse-Lautrec, At the Moulin Rouge","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XLcbGHNFcpM/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"xa5f779e9","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"The 1880s saw a shift away from the modern-life focus of Impressionism, as artists turned toward the interior self, to dreams, and myth. There was a sense that Impressionism had been too tied up with the materialism of middle-class culture. In some ways, van Gogh and Gauguin can also be seen as Symbolists. Many Symbolist belonged to groups of artists who broke away (or seceded) from the art establishment in their respective countries, to hold their own exhibitions.

Nevertheless, the old order would soon collapse, a result of the Great War in 1914. But this trauma was only the beginning. A global financial collapse precipitated by the stock market crash of 1929 allowed Mussolini, Franco and Hitler to seize power. The violence only worsened with the Holocaust, Japanese Imperial expansion, and the Second World War.\n\nAt the same time, this was a period of radical advances in music (Stravinsky, Bartok, etc.), in dance (Duncan, Graham, etc.) in literature (Joyce, Pound, etc.), science (Einstein, Heisenberg, etc.), and of course, in art (Matisse, Picasso, etc.).

As demobilized troops returned, German cities filled with unemployed, often maimed veterans. The Socialists briefly seized power and by the early 1920s hyperinflation further destabilized the nation. Neue Sachlichkeit or the New Objectivity cast a cold sharp eye on Modern Germany’s hypocrisy, aggression, and destitution even as extremists on the political right consolidated power. The National Socialists or Nazi Party won the chancellorship in 1933 and quickly used art and architecture as a means build the myth of a pure German people shaped by the land and unsullied by modern industrial culture.

By the first years of the 20th Century, a small group of American artists began to paint the gritty streets of New York and were called the Ashcan School for their portrayal of life in the tenements. In 1913 however, the Armory Show exhibited advanced American and European art and helped to create a market for the work of Georgia O’Keeffe and other members of modern galleries like Alfred Steiglitz’s 291 and Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of This Century. During the Great Depression artists such as Grant Wood portrayed rural life in the south and midwest and became known as regionalists while other realists such as Edward Hopper rendered the alienation of the modern city. Meanwhile, Surrealist ideas infused a younger generation of artists’ work in Mexico and the US which would result, by the end of WWII, in the first internationally important American art movement, Abstract Expressionism.","title":"American-Modernism","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1907-1960-age-of-global-conflict/American Modernism","children":[{"id":"671738047","title":"Bellows, Pennsylvania Station Excavation, c. 1907-8","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/CIH3VBBL69k/0.jpg"},{"id":"719611780","title":"Wood, American Gothic, 1930","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/vk2GvyNmYD0/0.jpg"},{"id":"670111818","title":"O'Keeffe, The Lawrence Tree, 1929","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/wQq2xOs2BYU/0.jpg"},{"id":"719611781","title":"Hopper, Nighthawks, 1942","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/j24uh8cZ3wA/0.jpg"},{"id":"669368697","title":"Frida Kahlo, Frieda and Diego Rivera, 1931","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/n2HWkDrorRg/0.jpg"},{"id":"1023446691","title":"Pollock's One: Number 31, 1950","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2JleSka1klc/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718107","title":"Mark Rothko's No. 3/No. 13, 1949","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/FnkATpF4O2Q/0.jpg"},{"id":"671634398","title":"Newman's Onement I, 1948","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4qgOSBHptLM/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718108","title":"de Kooning's Woman I, 1950-52","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WEYKoJTIHcE/0.jpg"},{"id":"1385500124","title":"Jasper Johns, Flag, 1954-55","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9bWJt2hjBH0/0.jpg"},{"id":"1390714408","title":"Robert Rauschenberg, Bed, 1955","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/tvpp2lAD9iY/0.jpg"}]}]},{"type":2,"id":"xde79809d","description":"By 1960, the unprecedented violence of the first half of the century had ebbed, replaced by the Cold War and threat of nuclear catastrophe.

Powerful, entrenched conservative institutions such as the Catholic Church were transformed. The assassinations of John F.

Here was an art that renounced the authentic “hand’ of the artist and sought instead to create forms without reference to the world beyond the object’s own logic except perhaps as Platonic expressions of a pure ideal.","title":"Art History: Minimalism","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1960---age-of-post-colonialism/minimalism","children":[{"id":"671656237","title":"Donald Judd, Untitled","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/G37C5vKCwH4/0.jpg"},{"id":"671738055","title":"Dan Flavin, Untitled (To Donna) II","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/jOGZKimS-b4/0.jpg"},{"id":"671385822","title":"Smithson, Spiral Jetty","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NUu0_Zn55yM/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"x2233bc2d","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"By the second half of the 20th Century, the avant-garde had an avant-garde of its own. Even as Pop, Minimal and Concept artists renounced the handmade work of art, a small group of women recognized the subversive value of handicraft in an age of industrial manufacturing and in an art world dominated by male artists and critics who sought theoretical purity. During her short career, Eva Hesse resituated the ancient question of how to meaningfully represent the human body and unleashed decades of experimentation that continues to this day. Judy Chicago, Linda Benglis, Jackie Windsor, Faith Ringgold, and others used the lowly status of craft and its historical association with female artisans to contrast with “high art.” By focusing of the act of making, on process and craft, these women began the process of fracturing Modernism’s reductive and largely male narratives.","title":"Art History: Process Art","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1960---age-of-post-colonialism/process-art","children":[{"id":"669368700","title":"Hesse, Untitled","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/jO1wp-Bx-WE/0.jpg"},{"id":"671656236","title":"Hesse, Untitled (Rope Piece), 1970","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-nrSCokEUXg/0.jpg"},{"id":"671634407","title":"Chicago, Pasadena Lifesaver, Blue Series, No. 4 & Benglis, Omega","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_dLpDljQWis/0.jpg"},{"id":"671634404","title":"Winsor, #1 Rope","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mn4D4eQxeMU/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"xefaf1d60","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"Can art be an enactment? Can the “art” be relocated from the object crafted by an artist to the more ephemeral reaction of the viewer? Must an artist actually “make” a work of art at all? Conceptual artists recognized that when the 19th Century avant-garde broke with the academies and their emphasis on technical execution (the blending color or compositional clarity for example), they were freer to focus on more conceptual issues such as modern urban life, subjectivity, or pictorial language. Fast forward to the second half of the Twentieth Century when intellectual content became the defining characteristic of art and concept fully eclipsed craft. In the 1960 and 70s the art of Beuys, Haacke and others became increasingly conceptual. These artists used found objects, performance, and installation while de-emphasizing the act of “object making.”","title":"Art History: Performance Art","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1960---age-of-post-colonialism/performance-art","children":[{"id":"671593320","title":"Joseph Beuys, Table with Accumulator","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QwfrTNuwE4/0.jpg"},{"id":"1064586560","title":"Hans Haacke's Seurat's 'Les Poseuses' (small version)","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/sdM6aGhKdTI/0.jpg"},{"id":"1020926923","title":"Hirst, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/uDuzy-t7GDA/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"x4e6180f9","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"If you’ve done the tutorials on Nineteenth and Twentieth Century art then you likely have an idea that by “Modernism,” art historians are referring to a set of ideas that characterize art and culture after about 1848. Key to understanding Modern art are the ideas of a heroic “avant-garde” that challenges authority and the expression of the individual (one that is invariably white and male). The term “Post-Modernism,” was initially used in the art world in 1979 for architecture that arbitrarily borrowed historical styles with little regard for original meaning or context. The term was quickly and broadly adopted, and came to refer to a strategy to undermine Modernism’s utopian and heroizing tendencies by using multiple yet simultaneous critical perspectives. Post-Modernism was not anti-Modernism, it was instead, an effort to destabilize Modernist narratives with deeply skeptical critical strategies that emphasized the plurality of gender, race, nationality, politics, and economic inequality.","title":"Art History: Postmodernism","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1960---age-of-post-colonialism/postmodernism","children":[{"id":"669368701","title":"Colescott, Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/FAwTjShZZpI/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718113","title":"Sherman, Untitled Film Still #21","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0fPwsLeH8fA/0.jpg"},{"id":"1159673415","title":"Sherrie Levine, Untitled (After Edward Weston, ca. 1925)","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9IZhzUDSBTY/0.jpg"}]}]}]},{"type":1,"id":"xd23db0ab","description":"Videos about how government works in the United States.","title":"American Civics","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/american-civics","children":[{"id":"887553535","title":"PPACA or \"Obamacare\"","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nW9L7cSop4/0.jpg"},{"id":"1184640213","title":"The Fiscal Cliff","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/lV3LBiivTxw/0.jpg"},{"id":"1184595421","title":"More Fiscal Cliff Analysis","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/QwvJ6z49m-c/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139729","title":"Electoral College","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/oTbvYGH_Hiw/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139731","title":"Primaries and Caucuses","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_QeYCg4yJ8/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139727","title":"Deficit and Debt Ceiling","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-05OfTp6ZEE/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139728","title":"Government's Financial Condition","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/LOiw5aBrm4Y/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139732","title":"Social Security Intro","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gLHUCUv1e5Y/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139733","title":"FICA Tax","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/UP9xy2eVj7s/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139730","title":"Medicare Sustainability","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/o1Y0G8Z67iU/0.jpg"},{"id":"508919772","title":"SOPA and PIPA","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzqMoOk9NWc/0.jpg"},{"id":"1163976627","title":"Pension obligations","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qBYa_QOWuaE/0.jpg"},{"id":"1163627770","title":"Illinois pension obligations","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tczu_dvVuuk/0.jpg"}]}]},{"type":0,"id":"x7626d097","title":"Test Prep","children":[{"type":1,"id":"xc8aa1bad","description":"Sal works through every problem in the first edition of the College Board \"Official SAT Study Guide\" (ISBN Number: 0-87447-718-2 published in 2004).

Also see: Pi is (still) Wrong: http://youtu.be/jG7vhMMXagQ\nPi in Binary Hand Dance: http://youtu.be/OCYZTg3jahU\nSpecial thanks to Toby (or not Toby) for playing Dog Hamlet.\n\nThis cool website lets you search the first 200,000,000 digits of Pi. See if your phone number or encoded name is in there! http://www.angio.net/pi/piquery\n\nSeven Sonnets:\n\nAre Shakespeare's plays encoded within Pi? \nThe truth is: we don't know, but we suspect\nThey're somewhere in those digits. And now I\nWill show why we don't know if we're correct.\n\nYou see, we think the digits do behave\nAs if they were a random sequence, and\nSo many mathematicians tried to brave\nThis question, but we still don't understand.\n\nPi isn't random: each digit must be\nExactly what the definition states.\nIt's pseudo-random, far as we can see,\nBut it's the subject of intense debates.\n\nNow I'll explain, with this parameter:\nIt's all in iambic pentameter.\n\nYou may have heard of this scenario:\nA thousand monkeys type at keyboards 'till\nThey write the works of Shakespeare. Even though,\nIn one life it's a task they can't fulfill.\n\nIf you allow their kids to carry on,\nAll through the generations working hard,\nThey will evolve before they come upon\nA single sonnet written by the Bard.\n\nBut still, the theory's sound! And it is true\nThat with a random and infinite set\nOf letters, that eventu-ally you\nWill find whatever words you want to get.\n\nHowever, on this thing you can depend:\nBefore you do, the universe will end.\n\n\nPi is a number, and that's why I can\nCompletely guarantee no part will be\n9-1-3-7-5-2-2-8-ten\n4-7-9-H-A-M-L-E-T.\n\nYou'd have to make up something, like a code\nWhere zero-one is A, Oh-three is C,\nOr you could also choose some other mode,\nOh-2 could be \"to be or not to be.\"\n\nBut let's go with this system, where a Y\nIs 2-5, O's one five, and R's eighteen,\nAnd next comes zero 9 which is an I,\nOh-three, eleven. Yorick's name is seen!\n\nDoes Pi say anything? How does it go?\n1-4-1-5. I guess the answer's \"no.\"\n\n\nIf you desire to search Pi for a thing\nLike Hamlet, as if you'd 'discover' it,\nWithout a copy used for referencing,\nYou wouldn't know if you'd recovered it.\n\nIn fact, it's almost certain, so beware:\nBefore you get to Hamlet, if you slog\nThrough all the digits, you'll find versions where\nThere's just one thing changed: Hamlet is a dog.\n\nDog Hamlet is so awesome and he goes\nOn infinitely many adventures.\nIn this infinite space everyone knows\nDog Hamlet's king. Sometimes he has dentures.\n\nUnless Pi isn't normal. I'll admit:\nPi might not have a single Dog Hamlet.\n\n\nA normal number is a number where,\nIf you take any pattern of length Z\nYou'll definitely find the pattern there,\nAnd others that length, with' same frequency.\n\nLength 1 would just be every digit, so\nAll digits happen infinity times.\nAnd all two-digit numbers also go\nIn there somewhere. If you list all the primes,\n\nYou get the Copeland-Erdos constant, which\nIs one of few known normal numbers. Or\nTake every number in order and stitch\nThem all together. And we know there's more.\n\nMost numbers must be of the normal kind,\nBut somehow they are hard for us to find.\n\n\nWe think that Pi is normal. Also e\nAnd square root 2 and other stuff like that.\nWe don't know how to prove that they must be,\nThat Pi contains Macbeth where he's a cat.\n\nIf you've got every combination of\nDigits of every length, that will include\nA Romeo and Juliet in love\nWho meet in time and live and end the feud.\n\nAnd since the strings of numbers must occur\nWith equal frequency to other strings\nOf the same length, it don't matter whether\nYou choose this code or other permutings.\n\nPerhaps somewhere Dog Hamlet and Catbeth\nAre chillin', bustin' ghosts, avoiding death.\n\n\nThere's simple open problems about pi,\nLike whether every digit, oh through nine,\nKeeps happening. We can't figure out why\n6 shouldn't stop appearing, down the line.\n\nIt seems ridiculous, to think that 2\nOccurs finitely many times. I fear,\nThat without proof, we can't say it's not true.\nAlas, poor Yorick may never appear.\n\nBut the exciting thing is that I think\nThese problems will be solved before too long.\nAnd then this video will really stink\nBecause all this not-knowing will be wrong.\n\nDon't worry; I look forward to its fall.\n'Till then, a happy Pi Day to you all.","title":"Are Shakespeare's Plays Encoded within Pi?","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/video/are-shakespeare-s-plays-encoded-within-pi","dateAdded":"2012-03-14T20:23:15Z","youTubeId":"uXoh6vi6J5U","vidUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/uXoh6vi6J5U.mp4/uXoh6vi6J5U.mp4","imgHiUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/uXoh6vi6J5U.mp4/uXoh6vi6J5U.png","parents":["x7a488390","xe7bbd8fa","xf48ec4ac","x0fc1ab8d"],"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/uXoh6vi6J5U/0.jpg"},{"id":"756692482","description":"A visual and musical expression of mathematical symmetry groups.

Rodin, The Gates of Hell​, 1880-1917, plaster (Musée d'Orsay, Paris)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker\n\nWhen the building, earlier on the site of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, was destroyed by fire during the Commune in 1871, plans were drawn up to replace it with a museum of decorative arts. Rodin won the competition to design a great set of doors for its entry way. Although the museum was never built, Rodin continued to work on the doors. They became an ongoing project; a grand stage for his sculptural ideas. It's fitting that the plaster of this great unfinished sculpture, The Gates of Hell, is now on display at the d'Orsay, the former railway terminal that was built on this site instead of the museum of decorative arts and that, by lovely coincidence, was converted into one of the world's great art museums.","title":"Rodin, The Gates of Hell","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/video/rodin--the-gates-of-hell---1880-1917","dateAdded":"2012-03-20T19:13:10Z","youTubeId":"TgLTzYXg530","vidUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/TgLTzYXg530.mp4/TgLTzYXg530.mp4","imgHiUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/TgLTzYXg530.mp4/TgLTzYXg530.png","parents":["x905db83d","x15c3149c","x3478cfee","xa5f779e9"],"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/TgLTzYXg530/0.jpg"},{"id":"670111814","description":"Antoni Gaudí, Church of the Sagrada Família or Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la \nSagrada Família Basilica, 1882- (consecrated 2010, but still under construction), \nBarcelona, Spain","title":"Gaudí, Sagrada Família","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/video/gaud---church-of-the-sagrada-fam-lia--1882---consecrated-2010--still-under-construction","dateAdded":"2012-03-20T19:13:09Z","youTubeId":"SMqERP-J2tQ","vidUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/SMqERP-J2tQ.mp4/SMqERP-J2tQ.mp4","imgHiUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/SMqERP-J2tQ.mp4/SMqERP-J2tQ.png","parents":["x905db83d","x15c3149c","x3478cfee","xa5f779e9"],"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SMqERP-J2tQ/0.jpg"},{"id":"670111816","description":"Henri Matisse, Luxe, calme et volupté, 1904, oil on canvas, 37 x 46 inches (Museé  d'Orsay, Paris)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker\n\nPainted while the artist stayed with the pointillist painter, Signac, at his home in Saint-Tropez on the Côte d'Azur.

Khan spoke to Googlers in Mountain View, California on March 15, 2011 about Khan Academy: A World Class Education to Anyone, Anywhere.\n\nSalman Khan is the founder and faculty of Khan Academy http://www.khanacademy.org/ a not-for-profit educational organization. With the stated mission \"of providing a high quality education to anyone, anywhere\", the Academy supplies a free online collection of over 2,000 videos on mathematics, history, finance, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and economics.\n\nIn late 2004, Khan began tutoring his cousin in mathematics using Yahoo!'s Doodle notepad. When other relatives and friends sought his tutorial, he decided it would be more practical to distribute the tutorials on YouTube. Their popularity there and the testimonials of appreciative students prompted Khan to quit his job in finance in 2009 and focus on the Academy full-time.\n\nKhan Academy's channel on YouTube http://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy has 45+ million views so far and it's one of YouTube's most successful academic partners.\n\nIn September 2010, Google announced they would be providing the Khan Academy with $2 million to support the creation of more courses and to enable the Khan Academy to translate their core library into the world's most widely spoken languages, as part of Project 10^100, http://www.project10tothe100.com/.\n\nKhan is aiming at making nothing less than \"tens of thousands\" of tutorials offering the \"first free, world-class virtual school where anyone can learn anything.\"","title":"Authors@Google: Salman Khan","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/video/authors-google--salman-khan","dateAdded":"2011-03-31T00:00:16Z","youTubeId":"PhO2gshIVuE","vidUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/PhO2gshIVuE.mp4/PhO2gshIVuE.mp4","imgHiUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/PhO2gshIVuE.mp4/PhO2gshIVuE.png","parents":["xd1039e22","xdea303c8"],"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/PhO2gshIVuE/0.jpg"},{"id":"1101921746","description":"Sal talks with Larry Mantle about The One World School House (http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455508381?tag=khanacad-20)","title":"Radio Interview: Sal on AirTalk talking about his new book","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/video/sal-on-airtalk-talking-about-his-new-book","dateAdded":"2012-10-23T16:39:06Z","youTubeId":"l-QFT7XNeb4","vidUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/l-QFT7XNeb4.mp4/l-QFT7XNeb4.mp4","imgHiUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/l-QFT7XNeb4.mp4/l-QFT7XNeb4.png","parents":["xd1039e22","xdea303c8"],"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/l-QFT7XNeb4/0.jpg"},{"id":"23730","description":"An overview of the Khan Academy today and what I see as its potential social impact","title":"Khan Academy Vision and Social Return","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/video/khan-academy-vision-and-social-return","dateAdded":"2011-02-20T16:45:49Z","youTubeId":"wRf6XiEZ_Y8","vidUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/wRf6XiEZ_Y8.mp4/wRf6XiEZ_Y8.mp4","imgHiUrl":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/KA-youtube-converted/wRf6XiEZ_Y8.mp4/wRf6XiEZ_Y8.png","parents":["xd1039e22","x39b8b564"],"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/wRf6XiEZ_Y8/0.jpg"},{"id":"775653951","description":"Watch an insider's tour of Khan Academy with founder Sal Khan.
