Charlemagne and the Ottonians had partially and briefly unified the West, and of course the Church was a stabilizing institution, but it was only in the 11th Century that everything changed. Now there was finally enough peace and prosperity to allow for travel and for the widespread construction of large buildings. These were, with rare exceptions, the first large structures to be built in the West since the fall of the Romans so many centuries before. We call the period Romanesque (Roman-like) because the masons of this period looked back to the architecture of ancient Rome. The relative calm of the Romanesque period also meant it was possible to travel, and the faithful set out on pilgrimages in great numbers to visit holy relics in churches across Europe. This meant that ideas and styles also traveled, towns grew and churches were built and enlarged.","title":"Art History: Romanesque","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-400-1300-medieval---byzantine-eras/romanesque","children":[{"id":"xe0420f8b","title":"Pentecost and Mission to the Apostles Tympanum, Vézelay","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dnxm4UQPDTo/0.jpg"},{"id":"785173745","title":"Last Judgment Tympanum, Cathedral of St. Lazare, Autun","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/PATkTJhAUhM/0.jpg"},{"id":"686563916","title":"Wise and Foolish Virgins, Sant Quirze de Pedret","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXJMwIDx29Q/0.jpg"},{"id":"671711105","title":"Virgin from Ger","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/KwYhMXjMlvc/0.jpg"},{"id":"671422823","title":"Historiated Capitals, Church of Sant Miquel, Camarasa (Noguera)","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/hPYOMKQlU1g/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"xf59d3d2c","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"No, we’re not talking about the dark subculture we know as Goth!

But Pacher spoke German, and the specific area he was from (today in the north-east of Italy), was known as Tyrol (though there is a state of Tyrol today in Austria). Confusing, we know. In this tutorial, we take a look at Pacher’s amazing St. Wolfgang Altarpiece which is still in the church it was made for—a church on a lake surrounded by mountains in Austria, still visited by religious pilgrims. Most altarpieces in the Renaissance were made of many interconnected panels that were later sold and ended up in different collections, and this means that to see one altarpiece you usually have to travel to many museums. But this is not true of the St. Wolfgang altarpiece. Seeing a Renaissance work of art in the space it was made for helps us to travel back in time to the late 15th Century.","title":"Art History: Tyrol","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1400-1500-renaissance-in-italy-and-the-north/tyrol","children":[{"id":"1258345468","title":"Pacher, St. Wolfgang Altarpiece","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/KdDIIYqXmjw/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"xcb8e1975","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"The International Gothic Style persists into the 15th Century in many courts in Europe including England.","title":"New Topic","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1400-1500-renaissance-in-italy-and-the-north/england","children":[{"id":"x14c3bd4b","title":"The Harrowing of Hell, c. 1440-70","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/katx69CGBwo/0.jpg"}]}]},{"type":2,"id":"xf1cfbea9","description":"If there was one century in the past that saw radical changes in established ways of thinking comparable to the 20th Century, it would be the 16th. Before this, in Western Europe, there was only one type of Christianity—under the authority of the Pope in Rome. But in 1517 a German theologian and monk, Martin Luther, sparked the Protestant Reformation. His ideas spread quickly, thanks in part to the printing press. Luther challenged the power of the Pope and the Church, and asserted the authority of individual conscience. At the same time, it was increasingly possible for people to read the bible in the languages that they spoke. It is also during this period that the Scientific Revolution began and observation replaced religious doctrine as the source of our understanding of the universe and our place in it. At mid-century, Copernicus suggested that the sun was at the center of solar system (not the earth), radically repositioning human beings and therefore calling into question our centrality in the universe that God had created.","title":"1500-1600 End of the Renaissance and the Reformation","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1500-1600-end-of-the-renaissance-and-the-reformation","children":[{"type":3,"id":"x9a536edf","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"We don’t call this the “High” Renaissance for nothing!

One of the greatest artist of this period, Rembrandt, made his name as a portrait painter, but was also a printmaker, and his work also includes moving interpretations of biblical subjects (though from a Protestant perspective).","title":"Art History: Holland","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1600-1700-the-baroque/holland","children":[{"id":"671686569","title":"Vermeer, Young Woman with a Water Pitcher","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_38xl7p4VaM/0.jpg"},{"id":"708138866","title":"Vermeer, The Glass of Wine","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/uvA6YY4yHtM/0.jpg"},{"id":"671622662","title":"Rembrandt, Bathsheba at her Bath","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/wsL4Uh0BrQw/0.jpg"},{"id":"671622663","title":"Rembrandt, Girl at a Window","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xSixUm1cXSw/0.jpg"},{"id":"671707171","title":"Rembrandt, The Three Crosses","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PA0T4_KYC0/0.jpg"},{"id":"708138867","title":"Hals, Singing Boy with Flute","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/iQ5uG6ryCa4/0.jpg"},{"id":"671686574","title":"Van Huysum, Vase with Flowers","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WOnOq9YIrWI/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"x51288d14","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"The main focus of this tutorial, and a leading artist at this time is the great Diego Velazquez, who spent most of his career as the court painter to the King of Spain painting official portraits.

More and more people lived in cities and worked in factories or shops for wages. Scientific and technological advances increased dramatically during this period and although there was dislocation and privation, standards of living increased sharply. In essence, modern mass culture was born. Artists responded sometimes by embracing these radical changes, and at other times by resisting them. Key here is understanding the authority of the various art academies in Europe, which controlled matters related to taste and art, and which were, to some extent, always connected to the government. A small number of artists rebelled against the strictures of the academy, and against the demand for art to tell clear stories for a middle class audience, and formed what we know as the “avant-garde.”","title":"1848-1907 Industrial Revolution II","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1848-1907-industrial-revolution-ii","children":[{"type":3,"id":"xe6a81777","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"In 1848, a small group of young artists banded together and formed “The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood,” a name which sounds intentionally backward-looking and medieval.

Courbet painted the reality of life in the countryside—not the idealized peasants that were the usual fare at the exhibits in Paris. The revolution of 1848, in which both the working class and the middle class played a significant role, set the stage for Realism. Later, Manet and then Degas painted modern life in Paris, a city which was undergoing rapid modernization in the period after 1855 (the Second Empire).","title":"Art History: Realism","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1848-1907-industrial-revolution-ii/realism","children":[{"id":"671385804","title":"Courbet, Burial at Ornans","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/zRuLkyLx3No/0.jpg"},{"id":"669368683","title":"Courbet, The Artist's Studio, A real allegory summing up seven years of my artistic and moral life","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SvFtmPhbNRw/0.jpg"},{"id":"671385805","title":"Bonheur, Plowing in the Nivernais","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/kOnzZHJYzb4/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718098","title":"Bonheur, Sheep in the Highlands","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/76gw8PA12ag/0.jpg"},{"id":"671593303","title":"Millet, L'Angelus","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/3KjZ3w5MtBo/0.jpg"},{"id":"671656228","title":"Millet, The Gleaners","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dk1nuM5JKqQ/0.jpg"},{"id":"671593304","title":"Degas, The Dance Class","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NigP3DjV3NY/0.jpg"},{"id":"671385812","title":"Degas, The Bellelli Family","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/irLOxG7SpUk/0.jpg"},{"id":"719842167","title":"Degas, At the Races in the Countryside","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/6HTBjvqn9uw/0.jpg"},{"id":"719474985","title":"Degas, Visit to a Museum","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvtPCKwGZCU/0.jpg"},{"id":"671634396","title":"Manet, Le déjeuner sur l'herbe","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nb_4nEFyeGk/0.jpg"},{"id":"1239463263","title":"Manet, Olympia","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/bihBbqzL96Y/0.jpg"},{"id":"670111809","title":"Manet, Émile Zola","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/znKX9WcowfY/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718099","title":"Manet, The Balcony","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/XS8OhYdc-20/0.jpg"},{"id":"669368684","title":"Manet, The Railway","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GD1Oz0sPzY/0.jpg"},{"id":"669368687","title":"Manet, Plum Brandy","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/K3XTsNlcDS8/0.jpg"},{"id":"708126673","title":"Manet, In the Conservatory","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/eNhrYgYV0MA/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718101","title":"Manet, Corner of a Café-Concert","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/BXzR-hdSFUY/0.jpg"},{"id":"671385816","title":"Manet, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/kMACjCg9r4E/0.jpg"},{"id":"719781806","title":"Homer, The Fog Warning (Halibut Fishing)","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9s_uJlG3b8/0.jpg"},{"id":"708153520","title":"Homer, The Life Line","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WV3MXLAfIi4/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"x79e94e3a","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"Despite the brief dismantling of the Royal Academy during the French Revolution, art remained an extension of the power of the French State which regularly purchased art that it favored (often art that supported its political objectives).

These were not just the official institutions of art, they were, in essence, the only institutions available for living artists to train and to make their work known.

As demobilized troops returned, German cities filled with unemployed, often maimed veterans. The Socialists briefly seized power and by the early 1920s hyperinflation further destabilized the nation. Neue Sachlichkeit or the New Objectivity cast a cold sharp eye on Modern Germany’s hypocrisy, aggression, and destitution even as extremists on the political right consolidated power. The National Socialists or Nazi Party won the chancellorship in 1933 and quickly used art and architecture as a means build the myth of a pure German people shaped by the land and unsullied by modern industrial culture. This tutorial looks at the ways that competing political ideologies each used art for its own purposes.","title":"Art History: Neue Sachlichkeit","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1907-1960-age-of-global-conflict/neue-sachlichkeit","children":[{"id":"671634402","title":"Feininger, Cathedral for the Bauhaus","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/hip59oIFSMQ/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718111","title":"Moholy-Nagy, Composition A.XX","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YeBe-yDGVnU/0.jpg"},{"id":"1283943191","title":"Moholy-Nagy, Climbing the Mast","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/QlQjCQ5SXco/0.jpg"},{"id":"669368693","title":"Sander, Portraits","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qZ1ofSJBxBU/0.jpg"},{"id":"669368690","title":"Umbo, The Roving Reporter","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ukjw0Doy65Q/0.jpg"},{"id":"671738050","title":"Dix, Portrait of the Journalist Sylvia von Harden","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/sHkZWu9tgpw/0.jpg"},{"id":"671593316","title":"Schad, Self-Portrait","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/jEVfDSfO9Gw/0.jpg"},{"id":"1159755291","title":"Troost, House of German Art & the Entartete Kunst Exhibition","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/hpY22uSAPAA/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"xf380cbcd","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"Towers of glass and steel from the mid-20th Century suggest, for many people, the rationalization of urban space that dehumanized our cities with empty plazas, rigorous geometries and uniformity.

Before the Civil War, many of America’s best artists went to Europe and stayed. Even after the war, American artists found little enthusiasm for their work unless it was directly informed by European precedents. By the first years of the 20th Century, a small group of American artists began to paint the gritty streets of New York and were called the Ashcan School for their portrayal of life in the tenements. In 1913 however, the Armory Show exhibited advanced American and European art and helped to create a market for the work of Georgia O’Keeffe and other members of modern galleries like Alfred Steiglitz’s 291 and Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of This Century. During the Great Depression artists such as Grant Wood portrayed rural life in the south and midwest and became known as regionalists while other realists such as Edward Hopper rendered the alienation of the modern city. Meanwhile, Surrealist ideas infused a younger generation of artists’ work in Mexico and the US which would result, by the end of WWII, in the first internationally important American art movement, Abstract Expressionism.","title":"American-Modernism","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1907-1960-age-of-global-conflict/American Modernism","children":[{"id":"671738047","title":"Bellows, Pennsylvania Station Excavation, c. 1907-8","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/CIH3VBBL69k/0.jpg"},{"id":"719611780","title":"Wood, American Gothic, 1930","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/vk2GvyNmYD0/0.jpg"},{"id":"670111818","title":"O'Keeffe, The Lawrence Tree, 1929","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/wQq2xOs2BYU/0.jpg"},{"id":"719611781","title":"Hopper, Nighthawks, 1942","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/j24uh8cZ3wA/0.jpg"},{"id":"669368697","title":"Frida Kahlo, Frieda and Diego Rivera, 1931","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/n2HWkDrorRg/0.jpg"},{"id":"1023446691","title":"Pollock's One: Number 31, 1950","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2JleSka1klc/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718107","title":"Mark Rothko's No. 3/No. 13, 1949","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/FnkATpF4O2Q/0.jpg"},{"id":"671634398","title":"Newman's Onement I, 1948","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4qgOSBHptLM/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718108","title":"de Kooning's Woman I, 1950-52","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WEYKoJTIHcE/0.jpg"},{"id":"xaab5948f","title":"Robert Motherwell, Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 57, 1957-60","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/C89z5GncK88/0.jpg"},{"id":"1385500124","title":"Jasper Johns, Flag, 1954-55","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9bWJt2hjBH0/0.jpg"},{"id":"1390714408","title":"Robert Rauschenberg, Bed, 1955","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/tvpp2lAD9iY/0.jpg"}]}]},{"type":2,"id":"xde79809d","description":"By 1960, the unprecedented violence of the first half of the century had ebbed, replaced by the Cold War and threat of nuclear catastrophe. The vacuum left by European powers as they withdrew from their colonies instigated a global power grab as small nations sought autonomy but became proxies in a global strategic confrontation between Western and Soviet or Chinese ideologies. \n\nAt the same time protest movements in the West called for an end to war, racism, and gender inequality. Powerful, entrenched conservative institutions such as the Catholic Church were transformed. The assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., coupled later with Watergate, created a deep distrust for institutional authority.

During her short career, Eva Hesse resituated the ancient question of how to meaningfully represent the human body and unleashed decades of experimentation that continues to this day. Judy Chicago, Linda Benglis, Jackie Windsor, Faith Ringgold, and others used the lowly status of craft and its historical association with female artisans to contrast with “high art.” By focusing of the act of making, on process and craft, these women began the process of fracturing Modernism’s reductive and largely male narratives.","title":"Art History: Process Art","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1960---age-of-post-colonialism/process-art","children":[{"id":"669368700","title":"Hesse, Untitled","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/jO1wp-Bx-WE/0.jpg"},{"id":"671656236","title":"Hesse, Untitled (Rope Piece), 1970","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-nrSCokEUXg/0.jpg"},{"id":"671634407","title":"Chicago, Pasadena Lifesaver, Blue Series, No. 4 & Benglis, Omega","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_dLpDljQWis/0.jpg"},{"id":"671634404","title":"Winsor, #1 Rope","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mn4D4eQxeMU/0.jpg"}]},{"type":3,"id":"xefaf1d60","domainId":"x905db83d","description":"Can art be an enactment?

Key to understanding Modern art are the ideas of a heroic “avant-garde” that challenges authority and the expression of the individual (one that is invariably white and male). The term “Post-Modernism,” was initially used in the art world in 1979 for architecture that arbitrarily borrowed historical styles with little regard for original meaning or context. The term was quickly and broadly adopted, and came to refer to a strategy to undermine Modernism’s utopian and heroizing tendencies by using multiple yet simultaneous critical perspectives. Post-Modernism was not anti-Modernism, it was instead, an effort to destabilize Modernist narratives with deeply skeptical critical strategies that emphasized the plurality of gender, race, nationality, politics, and economic inequality.","title":"Art History: Postmodernism","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history/art-history-1960---age-of-post-colonialism/postmodernism","children":[{"id":"669368701","title":"Colescott, Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/FAwTjShZZpI/0.jpg"},{"id":"671718113","title":"Sherman, Untitled Film Still #21","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0fPwsLeH8fA/0.jpg"},{"id":"1159673415","title":"Sherrie Levine, Untitled (After Edward Weston, ca. 1925)","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9IZhzUDSBTY/0.jpg"}]}]}]},{"type":1,"id":"xd23db0ab","description":"Videos about how government works in the United States.","title":"American Civics","kaUrl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/american-civics","children":[{"id":"887553535","title":"PPACA or \"Obamacare\"","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nW9L7cSop4/0.jpg"},{"id":"1184640213","title":"The Fiscal Cliff","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/lV3LBiivTxw/0.jpg"},{"id":"1184595421","title":"More Fiscal Cliff Analysis","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/QwvJ6z49m-c/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139729","title":"Electoral College","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/oTbvYGH_Hiw/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139731","title":"Primaries and Caucuses","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_QeYCg4yJ8/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139727","title":"Deficit and Debt Ceiling","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/-05OfTp6ZEE/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139728","title":"Government's Financial Condition","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/LOiw5aBrm4Y/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139732","title":"Social Security Intro","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gLHUCUv1e5Y/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139733","title":"FICA Tax","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/UP9xy2eVj7s/0.jpg"},{"id":"225139730","title":"Medicare Sustainability","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/o1Y0G8Z67iU/0.jpg"},{"id":"508919772","title":"SOPA and PIPA","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzqMoOk9NWc/0.jpg"},{"id":"1163976627","title":"Pension obligations","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qBYa_QOWuaE/0.jpg"},{"id":"1163627770","title":"Illinois pension obligations","type":4,"imgUrl":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tczu_dvVuuk/0.jpg"}]}]},{"type":0,"id":"x7626d097","title":"Test Prep","children":[{"type":1,"id":"xc8aa1bad","description":"Sal works through every problem in the first edition of the College Board \"Official SAT Study Guide\" (ISBN Number: 0-87447-718-2 published in 2004).

Also see: Pi is (still) Wrong: http://youtu.be/jG7vhMMXagQ\nPi in Binary Hand Dance: http://youtu.be/OCYZTg3jahU\nSpecial thanks to Toby (or not Toby) for playing Dog Hamlet.\n\nThis cool website lets you search the first 200,000,000 digits of Pi. See if your phone number or encoded name is in there! http://www.angio.net/pi/piquery\n\nSeven Sonnets:\n\nAre Shakespeare's plays encoded within Pi? \nThe truth is: we don't know, but we suspect\nThey're somewhere in those digits. And now I\nWill show why we don't know if we're correct.\n\nYou see, we think the digits do behave\nAs if they were a random sequence, and\nSo many mathematicians tried to brave\nThis question, but we still don't understand.\n\nPi isn't random: each digit must be\nExactly what the definition states.\nIt's pseudo-random, far as we can see,\nBut it's the subject of intense debates.\n\nNow I'll explain, with this parameter:\nIt's all in iambic pentameter.\n\nYou may have heard of this scenario:\nA thousand monkeys type at keyboards 'till\nThey write the works of Shakespeare. Even though,\nIn one life it's a task they can't fulfill.\n\nIf you allow their kids to carry on,\nAll through the generations working hard,\nThey will evolve before they come upon\nA single sonnet written by the Bard.\n\nBut still, the theory's sound! And it is true\nThat with a random and infinite set\nOf letters, that eventu-ally you\nWill find whatever words you want to get.\n\nHowever, on this thing you can depend:\nBefore you do, the universe will end.\n\n\nPi is a number, and that's why I can\nCompletely guarantee no part will be\n9-1-3-7-5-2-2-8-ten\n4-7-9-H-A-M-L-E-T.\n\nYou'd have to make up something, like a code\nWhere zero-one is A, Oh-three is C,\nOr you could also choose some other mode,\nOh-2 could be \"to be or not to be.\"\n\nBut let's go with this system, where a Y\nIs 2-5, O's one five, and R's eighteen,\nAnd next comes zero 9 which is an I,\nOh-three, eleven. Yorick's name is seen!\n\nDoes Pi say anything? How does it go?\n1-4-1-5. I guess the answer's \"no.\"\n\n\nIf you desire to search Pi for a thing\nLike Hamlet, as if you'd 'discover' it,\nWithout a copy used for referencing,\nYou wouldn't know if you'd recovered it.\n\nIn fact, it's almost certain, so beware:\nBefore you get to Hamlet, if you slog\nThrough all the digits, you'll find versions where\nThere's just one thing changed: Hamlet is a dog.\n\nDog Hamlet is so awesome and he goes\nOn infinitely many adventures.\nIn this infinite space everyone knows\nDog Hamlet's king. Sometimes he has dentures.\n\nUnless Pi isn't normal. I'll admit:\nPi might not have a single Dog Hamlet.\n\n\nA normal number is a number where,\nIf you take any pattern of length Z\nYou'll definitely find the pattern there,\nAnd others that length, with' same frequency.\n\nLength 1 would just be every digit, so\nAll digits happen infinity times.\nAnd all two-digit numbers also go\nIn there somewhere. If you list all the primes,\n\nYou get the Copeland-Erdos constant, which\nIs one of few known normal numbers. Or\nTake every number in order and stitch\nThem all together. And we know there's more.\n\nMost numbers must be of the normal kind,\nBut somehow they are hard for us to find.\n\n\nWe think that Pi is normal. Also e\nAnd square root 2 and other stuff like that.\nWe don't know how to prove that they must be,\nThat Pi contains Macbeth where he's a cat.\n\nIf you've got every combination of\nDigits of every length, that will include\nA Romeo and Juliet in love\nWho meet in time and live and end the feud.\n\nAnd since the strings of numbers must occur\nWith equal frequency to other strings\nOf the same length, it don't matter whether\nYou choose this code or other permutings.\n\nPerhaps somewhere Dog Hamlet and Catbeth\nAre chillin', bustin' ghosts, avoiding death.\n\n\nThere's simple open problems about pi,\nLike whether every digit, oh through nine,\nKeeps happening. We can't figure out why\n6 shouldn't stop appearing, down the line.\n\nIt seems ridiculous, to think that 2\nOccurs finitely many times.

Rodin, The Gates of Hell​, 1880-1917, plaster (Musée d'Orsay, Paris)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker\n\nWhen the building, earlier on the site of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, was destroyed by fire during the Commune in 1871, plans were drawn up to replace it with a museum of decorative arts. Rodin won the competition to design a great set of doors for its entry way. Although the museum was never built, Rodin continued to work on the doors. They became an ongoing project; a grand stage for his sculptural ideas.
